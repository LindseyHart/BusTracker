# BusTracker
<h3>Desciption</h3>
<p>The intent of this project is to create a map with a marker on it that is following a bus in real time.</p>
<h3>How to Run</h3>
<p>To run this project please go to this url:https://lindseyhart.github.io/BusTracker/</p>
<h3>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h3>
<p>This is still a work in progress as I haven't been able to get the map to show up yet. That is my first step in fixing this project. After that I will work on making the stops show up and making sure the marker moves along those stops. The last thing I will make sure is that the marker is moving in real time.</p>
